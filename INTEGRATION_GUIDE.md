## Common Issues

### "Admin dashboard not accessible"
- Make sure you're logged in with an admin account
- Check that your user has admin role in Supabase

### "Payment not processing"
- Verify Stripe keys are set in Supabase
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure Supabase edge functions are deployed

### "Onboarding redirects to wrong place"
- The cosmic onboarding should redirect to /pay
- Check the CosmicOnboarding.tsx component in payments app
