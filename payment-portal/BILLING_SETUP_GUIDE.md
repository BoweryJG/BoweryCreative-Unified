## Deploying the System

supabase functions deploy admin-create-invoice
supabase functions deploy admin-create-portal-session
```

### 2. Run Database Migrations
```bash
supabase db push
```

### 3. Environment Variables Needed
Make sure these are set in your Supabase project:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `SITE_URL` (your domain)

### 4. Configure Stripe
1. Set up Stripe billing portal in Stripe Dashboard
2. Configure webhook endpoints if not already done
3. Ensure products/prices are created for subscriptions

## Features for Future Enhancement

## API Usage Tracking
For clients who need API usage tracking:
1. Enable "Track API Usage" when creating customer
2. System tracks:
   - Daily/monthly request counts
   - Endpoint usage
   - Response times
   - Rate limiting
3. Can set custom limits and overage pricing

## Email Templates
The system sends professional emails for:
- Welcome/setup instructions

- Payment reminders

## Security Features

2. Use Stripe test cards (4242 4242 4242 4242)
3. Verify emails are sent correctly
4. Test invoice payment flow
5. Check customer portal access

## Support & Troubleshooting
- Check Supabase logs for function errors

5. Send first invoice

The system is designed to provide that "stunning, memorable, seamless" experience you wanted, with a professional look and smooth payment flow.
