# Immediate Actions to Fix the Confusion

## üö® Quick Wins (Do Today)

### 1. Rename Folders for Clarity
```bash
mv dashboard mission-control
mv payments payment-portal
```

### 2. Update README.md with Clear Descriptions
```markdown
- payment-portal/     ‚Üí Client payment processing ONLY
- mission-control/    ‚Üí Internal agency management (all tools)
```

### 3. Remove Duplicate Components

**From payment-portal/, DELETE:**
- `src/components/admin/`
- `src/components/ClientManagementEnhanced.tsx`
- `src/components/InvoiceManagement.tsx` 
- `src/components/BoweryCreativeChatbot.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` (keep only payment dashboard)

**Keep in payment-portal/:**
- Payment forms
- Subscription selection
- Credit package selection
- Stripe checkout
- Success/cancel pages

### 4. Create Clear Entry Points

**payment-portal/src/App.tsx:**
- Route: `/pay/:invoiceId` ‚Üí PayInvoice component
- Route: `/subscribe` ‚Üí SubscriptionPlans component  
- Route: `/credits` ‚Üí CreditPackages component
- Remove all admin routes

**mission-control/src/App.tsx:**
- Keep all existing features
- Add any missing billing views
- This is your main work environment

### 5. Update Environment Variables

**payment-portal/.env:**
```
VITE_APP_NAME="BoweryCreative Payment Portal"
VITE_APP_URL="https://pay.bowerycreative.com"
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
```

**mission-control/.env:**
```
VITE_APP_NAME="BoweryCreative Mission Control"
VITE_APP_URL="https://app.bowerycreative.com"
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
```

## üìù Database Considerations

The `payment-portal` should only have READ access to:
- `invoices` table (to display invoice details)
- `subscription_plans` table
- `credit_packages` table

And WRITE access to:
- `payments` table
- `payment_intents` table

Everything else stays in Mission Control!
